Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/dataoptimal)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.


Molecular Detection System (MDS) Quantification App:

![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/Main.PNG)

What does it do?
Adds ability for the 3M Molecular Detection System to not ony identify food contaminants but to quantify the contaminant as well.

Why is this useful?
Products with medium contamination can be cooked and frozen for consumer use. Products with low contamination can be sold as raw products. The product has the potential to enter a 16 million dollar market.

How does it do it?
By using Machine Learning models hosted in Azure that predicts and quantifies bacteria based on MDS data output.


Features Manual and Automatic Saving:
