Molecular Detection System (MDS) Quantification:

**Note:**
I cannot provide code for the graphic user interface or models due to confidentiality agreements.

**What does it do?**

Adds ability for the 3M Molecular Detection System to not ony identify food contaminants but to quantify the contaminant as well.

**Why is this useful?**

Products with medium contamination can be cooked and frozen for consumer use. Products with low contamination can be sold as raw products. The product has the potential to enter a 16 million dollar market.

**How does it do it?**

By using Machine Learning models hosted in Azure that predicts and quantifies bacteria based on MDS data output.
